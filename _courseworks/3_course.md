I presented work on two mid-stage projects at the MIT Algorithms and Behavioral Science Coffee (Economics and Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems). The talk involved identifying a principled framework for unearthing large amounts of incoherence from language models, as well as identifying failures in analogical reasoning. Slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mGliM2yW9YS3cDsb6KtqYcS7-CCGKwpp5fyPXUGqmpo/edit?usp=sharing).
