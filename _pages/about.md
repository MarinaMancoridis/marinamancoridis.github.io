I am a first-year PhD student in the EECS department at MIT, advised by [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://sendhil.org/). I am grateful to be supported by the MIT Presidential Graduate Fellowship. I am interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence with psychology and decision-making.

I graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a degree in Computer Science. At Princeton, I worked with [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php) in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/). You can download my CV [here](/files/Marina_Mancoridis_CV_Sept_2024.pdf).

I also enjoy [singing and playing guitar](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1JgL4xpqLXXMX4rG1E2wnD?si=_VUlDYu6SXGjbfifFEeiMQ)!**
