## About

I am a first-year PhD student in the EECS department at MIT, advised by [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://sendhil.org/). I am grateful to be supported by the MIT Presidential Graduate Fellowship. I am interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence with psychology and decision-making.

I graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with a degree in Computer Science. At Princeton, I worked with [Tom Griffiths](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/tom.php) in the [Computational Cognitive Science Lab](https://cocosci.princeton.edu/). Upon graduating, I received the Calvin Dodd MacCracken Senior Thesis Award for the most inventive and technically accomplished senior thesis in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. You can download my full CV [here](/files/marinamancoridis_cv.pdf) and my one-page resume [here](/files/Marina_Mancoridis_CV_APR_2025.pdf).

My recent paper, [Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21521), formalizes and benchmarks conceptual understanding in language models—work that has sparked discussion on [Twitter](https://x.com/GaryMarcus/status/1938629881820323940) and in the AI community.

I also enjoy [singing and playing guitar](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1JgL4xpqLXXMX4rG1E2wnD?si=_VUlDYu6SXGjbfifFEeiMQ).
